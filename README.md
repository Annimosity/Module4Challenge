I need to build a coding test that looks nice, will log scores, has a timer that ends the test

So I will make a questionare and make a timer,
When I answer a question
Then I am presented with another question
When I answer a question incorrectly
Then time is subtracted from the clock
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
the game ends, and I will be able to save my score

To Do: 
add hidden class to start button, 
add javascript questions to dom,

maybe use buttons instead of p tags
Set up the code within the for loop (around line 19) to show the question's answers in the DOM.
Clean up the startButton click event listener - make sure any code that might be useful in other areas of the code is in its own function for reuseability.
Add some more question objects to the questions array
Get another event listener for those p tags so that you can respond to the user making a choice
    Within this listener, increase that i variable (around line 10) and get the logic to show the user the next question

These are reasonable action items for your tutoring session today ^^^ I anticipate you'll be able to get ~2-3 of them done during a 45 minute session. Maybe fewer, depending on the conversation.
